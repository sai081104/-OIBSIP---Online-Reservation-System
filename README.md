# 🛫 Online Reservation System

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple Java console app I built during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. It simulates a basic ticket reservation system — enter your travel details and get an instant confirmation!

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Takes user input:
  - Passenger Name  
  - Source Station  
  - Destination Station  
  - Date of Journey
- Displays a formatted reservation confirmation
- Runs entirely in the console

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff

- Language: **Java**
- IDE: **IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / Any Java IDE**
- Input: **Console-based using Scanner**
- JDK: **1.8+**

## 🎯 Why I Made It

This was Task 3 (Level 1) of my Java Development Internship with Oasis Infobyte.  
It was a great opportunity to practice user input handling, string manipulation, and creating clean output formatting in Java.

---

## 💻 How to Run It

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Open `OnlineReservationSystem.java` in your Java IDE  
3. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   javac OnlineReservationSystem.java
